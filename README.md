# conversational-chatbot
This project is a conversational chatbot that integrates the powerful Llama model from Ollama, LangChain for orchestrating data flow, and Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface. The chatbot is designed to handle a wide variety of topics, such as technology, weather, entertainment, and more, while engaging in dynamic, context-aware conversations. By leveraging LangChain, the chatbot can integrate with external APIs for real-time information, maintain memory for personalized interactions, and adapt to various conversation scenarios. With Streamlit, users can easily interact with the chatbot through a simple, responsive interface. The combination of these technologies allows for a versatile, engaging, and intelligent chatbot experience, ideal for applications like customer support, personal assistance, education, and entertainment.
